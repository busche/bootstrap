==============

Ranked by importance (-- least to ++ highest)

+ Convert command line parsing functionality into "well-known" format: -parameter1 arg -parameter2 -parameter3 arg
- Add @Convert Annotation instead of public static <T> convert(Object in) method
- Expand runnables - seeks for Runnable-implementations in the classpath and creates shell scripts for it.


Vage Ideas
==========

-- Add @Converter(clazz="") or @Converter(package="") annotation to be added to implementation classes. The functionality is scanning the clazz / package for @Converter annotations and build supplementary converters (to dynamically include converter between classes)
* Add a novel Annotation for Methods (to be used in interfaces) to support injection of properties for functional interfaces? Use-case: "multi-class inheritance" - e.g., composing controllers using delegates and unifying used interface into a single implementation.


Concrete Ideas
==============

Ranked by importance (-- least to ++ highest)

++ More intelligent error message if no converter was found
+ Convert command line parsing functionality into "well-known" format: -parameter1 arg -parameter2 -parameter3 arg
- Add @Convert Annotation instead of public static <T> convert(Object in) method


Vage Ideas
==========

-- Add @Converter(clazz="") or @Converter(package="") annotation to be added to implementation classes. The functionality is scanning the clazz / package for @Converter annotations and build supplementary converters (to dynamically include converter between classes)


Concrete Ideas
==============

Ranked by importance (-- least to ++ highest)

++ More intelligent error message if no converter was found
++ Add error / notification message, if no public getters / setters are present (as a hint for debugging) / Schilling 2013-05-17
++ Restart-Flag: (-restart): Prints the command line on Stdout for re-starting the job
+ Convert command line parsing functionality into "well-known" format: -parameter1 arg -parameter2 -parameter3 arg
- Add @Convert Annotation instead of public static <T> convert(Object in) method


Vage Ideas
==========

-- Add @Converter(clazz="") or @Converter(package="") annotation to be added to implementation classes. The functionality is scanning the clazz / package for @Converter annotations and build supplementary converters (to dynamically include converter between classes)
* Add a novel Annotation for Methods (to be used in interfaces) to support injection of properties for functional interfaces? Use-case: "multi-class inheritance" - e.g., composing controllers using delegates and unifying used interface into a single implementation.
